Guys ade 1 issue:

- kan event table reads user table -> ID as user_ID
- dh jadi, but when register
- there's error saying that SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1364 Field 'user_id' doesn't have a default value
- basically user_ID is not define la pdhl ID tu generated by system. Then, user_ID == id
- aku dh try byk kali pishg hehe

  2nd thing is
  - Other organiser still can edit delete event organiser laen
  - This is more on the crud event config laa
  - nnti bole try adjust balik
